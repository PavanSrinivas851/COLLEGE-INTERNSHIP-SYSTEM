# COLLEGE-INTERNSHIP-SYSTEM
The purpose of this project is to design, build and implement an internship coordinating system with anytime and anywhere access availability. All user and company information will be stored in a MySQL database and retrieved by PHP and ODBC. The main purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface for students and faculty members to interact with each other during the course of a student's internship class. Students can view their progress in real time and get the latest information every time they access the system. Moreover, the system offers the authorization function to make sure that students can access his/her records only and all the other information is kept discrete. The student's progress page gives read-only information to the student about his/her progress whereas the instructor can update the student's progress page and email the student for any information if needed. In the system, all the 2 users can manage their own account information such as changing passwords or e-mail addresses. And furthermore, the users have the same login as their department login in order to help users remember their login information. The system assigns a unique login to every user by following the same convention used by the department.
